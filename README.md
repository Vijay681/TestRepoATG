I have done the code as per given input files in resouces folder. I have tested it for all given input files and code runs fine and gives expected result. File is currently set to "input_0.xml" in the code in "fileName" variable but we can change file name and run code for each file. I could have set this file name in resouces folder but for this test I have set it in code.
